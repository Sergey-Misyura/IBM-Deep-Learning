# IBM  Deep Learning
Hello! Here are my [solutions](https://github.com/Sergey-Misyura/IBM-Deep-Learning) for the *free* version of courses [IBM Deep Learning](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/deep-learning) on [edX](https://www.edx.org/).<br/>
Courses in this pack:<br/>
* [1.Deep Learning Fundamentals with Keras](https://www.edx.org/course/deep-learning-fundamentals-with-keras)<br/>
* [2.Computer Vision and Image Processing Fundamentals](https://www.edx.org/course/computer-vision-and-image-processing-fundamentals)<br/>
* [3.PyTorch Basics for Machine Learning](https://www.edx.org/course/pytorch-basics-for-machine-learning)<br/>
* [4.Deep Learning with Python and PyTorch](https://www.edx.org/course/deep-learning-with-python-and-pytorch)<br/>
* [5.Deep Learning with Tensorflow](https://www.edx.org/course/deep-learning-with-tensorflow)<br/>
* [6.Applied Deep Learning Capstone Project](https://www.edx.org/course/applied-deep-learning-capstone-project)<br/>

Development environments is Jupyter notebook, SQL, skills network labs, IBM cloud (Db2, watson studio).<br/>

The final project is the *Classification of the denominations of European money*.<br/> 
Pre-trained neural networks are used: ResNet50, VGG16 in Keras; Densenet121, ResNet18 in PyTorch.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for watching, good luck!
